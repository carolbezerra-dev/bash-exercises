In this Block, I learned about:
- the tree DOM and how it works with Javascript and HTML;  
- how to reach element using `document.querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `getElementsByTagName`;  
- how to creat an element and append it with a parent;  
- how to reach an element using `parentNode`, `firstChild`, `previousElementSibling`, etc;  
- how to add events to tags, buttons using `addEventListener`;
- events are possible to add, like: `click`, `dblclick`, `keyup`, `mouseover`, etc;  
- cookies, localStorage and sessionStorage.  

Project time: I had 3 required projects and 2 bonus to practice all the knowledge learned until now, and I reached 100% grade in required and bonus topics in all them! :)
