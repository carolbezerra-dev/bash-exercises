In this Block, I learned about:
- the particular tags to create a form, like: `label`, `input` and your several `attributes`, `button type submit`, etc;  
- how these tools can help with good patterns in CSS and JavaScript, with functions ready to use;  
- how tech community is always creating more or improving these tools;  
- Flex Axes (Main and Cross), container properties (`flex-direction` and `flex-flow`), items properties (`justify-content`, `align-items` and `align-content`);  
- `align-self`, `order`, `flex-grow`, pseudo-class;  
- `media queries`, why it is important to apply Mobile First.  

In Project time, I reached 100% grade in required topics! :)
