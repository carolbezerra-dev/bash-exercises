# Block 3: Introduction - HTML & CSS

- [x] 3-1: _HTML & CSS - Page structures_  
I learned about initial tags: h1, p, a, img, strong, em, etc...  
- [x] 3-2: _HTML & CSS - First Steps in CSS_  
This was the first time I created a portfolio web and used GitHub Pages to help to see the final result. It is so nice to see my first steps. At the moment I created this repository, I was studying Introduction to HTML and CSS. I am sure that in the future, when I look back to this moment, I will feel proud of my first small job :)
