In this Block, I learned about initial tags: `h1`, `p`, `a`, `img`, `strong`, `em`, positioning in CSS and the importance to use the semantic tags and it was a preparation to the project.  
This was the first time I created a portfolio web and used GitHub Pages to help to see the final result. It is so nice to see my first steps. At the moment I created this repository, I was studying Introduction to HTML and CSS. I am sure that in the future, when I look back to this moment, I will feel proud of my first small job :)
