Hello!

#### Class 1 - Page Structure
In this repository I put the first challenges learning HTML. Learnings about initial tags: h1, p, a, img, strong, em, etc... Definitely, just a beginning

#### Class 2 - CSS - First Steps

This was the first time I created a portfolio web and used GitHub Pages to help to see the final result. It is so nice to see my first steps. At the moment I created this repository, I was studying Introduction to HTML and CSS. I am sure that in the future, when I look back to this moment, I will feel proud of my first small job :) Do not forget to check it here https://carolbezerra-dev.github.io/

#### Class 3 - Positioning
Learning about positioning in CSS

#### Class 4 - Semantic HTML
This class I learned the importance to use the semantic tags and it was a preparation to the project

#### Class 5 - HTML & CSS Project
Project time!
You will find all the details (in portuguese) of the project called Lessons Learned, it closed the block 3
I reached 100% grade in required and bonus topics! :)
