Hello!

#### Class 1 - Form
I learned the particular tags to create a form, like: label, input and your several attributes, button type submit, etc

#### Class 2 - Library and Frameworks
How these tools can help with good patterns in CSS and JavaScript, with functions ready to use  
And how tech community is always creating more or improving these tools
