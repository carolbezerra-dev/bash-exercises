# Block 11: Introduction - React

- [x] 11-1: _'Hello, world!' no React!_  
- [x] 11-2: _React Components_  
- [x] 11-3: _Project - Movie Cards Library_ - [CODE](https://github.com/carolbezerra-dev/trybe-projects/tree/main/2.FrontEnd/11.React-Introduction) and [PAGE](https://movie-cards-library-project.vercel.app/)  

In this Block, it was my first experience in React, I learned about Components and Props.  
I reached 100% grade in required topics! :)
