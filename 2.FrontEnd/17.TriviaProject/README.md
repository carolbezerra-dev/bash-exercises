## What should be developed

You should develop a question and answer game based on ** Trivia ** _ (like a million American rs show) _ using _React and Redux_, developing in group its functionalities according to the demands defined in a _Kanban_ table. From these demands, we will have an application where the user can:

  - Log in to the game and, if the email is registered on the [Gravatar] website (https://pt.gravatar.com/), have your photo associated with the user profile.
  - Access the page for the game, where you must choose one of the available answers for each of the questions presented. The answer must be checked before the time counter reaches zero, otherwise the answer must be considered wrong.
  - Be redirected, after 5 questions answered, to the score screen, where the text shown depends on the number of correct answers.
  - View the ranking page, if you wish, at the end of each game.
  - Configure some options for the game on a configuration screen accessible from the app header.
